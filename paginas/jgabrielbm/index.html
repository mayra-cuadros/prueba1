When I met you on your debut I was immediately captivated by dorky personality and beautiful character, especially your those alluring golden eyes of yours. Anywho thank you for changing my life for the better and I will always be there for you!</p>

Ever since your debut you were the most captivating to me from how creative you are, how kind you are to everyone, and just being really goofy to ease everyone up! You are my biggest inspiration to keep improving myself! So far I have picked up drawing again and learning Japanese. Shiori, thank you for being here! Here's to more happy days to come!</p>

Becoming a Novelite and seeing your passion for writing, as well as the prompts that you make for us, is part of why I've been able to write and create again myself! You truly brighten our days, and I look forward to celebrating future milestones too!</p>

I was just a clip watcher for a good while and you were my first actual oshi and I couldn't ask for a better one, you've given me a new found passion for art and I thank you for that as well. Don't ever stop going, thank you for all the streams. &lt;3</p>

I can scroll through all your uploads and remember a moment from every one of them, yet it doesn't feel real. You've really shown me how much can be done in 1 year. There's been ups and downs for me, but seeing what you've been through and how you deal with problems really motivates me. You remind me it's okay to go down, as long as we go back up.üñ§</p>

                        <p>Shioriii! You‚Äôre officially old lmao. But in all seriousness I‚Äôm actually happy you‚Äôre here with us, when you debuted along with Advent I was going through a rough time emotionally for that year. When you arrived I found myself feeling genuinely happy during these past months, a bonus since you enjoy Genshin and Honkai like me! I hope someday you get perms to play them on stream or get into play again. Cheers to the Archiver!</p>

                        <p>It doesn't even feel like a year. I've always been a fan of hololive, but I don't believe there has been a talent I've enjoyed quite like you, Shiori. The day you debuted was the last day of my crummy retail job. I was already excited to move on with my life and every subsequent stream really did help jettison myself to reach incredible heights. There isn't a quantifiable number of thank yous that can truly express my gratitude.</p>

Though I‚Äôve been checking out and supporting other members of Hololive ever since you‚Äôve introduced me to it, no one has stolen my heart quite like you. Waking up at 3 am and starting each day with your stream all throughout my senior year of HS was truly a wonderful experience.

                        <p>Happy 1-year Anniversary Shiori! I just wanted to thank you for being the one to make me go down the rabbit hole that is Hololive. You‚Äôre so incredibly unique in that you can be all cute and kinda dorky at times then immediately say something completely unexpected. Example: asking Nerissa if she kept Little Man‚Äôs balls. You keep everyone on their toes, especially Henmama. Here‚Äôs to another exciting year!</p>

I love your 3D, skits (trolley, cryptid), edutainment (though they're rare now), and gamer streams. I like how you're smart, patient, funny, and creative with both your words and ideas. I hope you know we appreciate your behind-the-scenes work too. And! I started doing steppies because of you. Let's create many more great memories together!</p>

You know, despite you being unique (in a good way) to the other members in hololive, you are one, if not, the most entertaining talent I have stumbled upon.
